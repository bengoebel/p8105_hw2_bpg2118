#### **Problem 1**

Let’s do the following:

-   Read in the excel file for the Mr. Trash Wheel data set
-   Clean the variables names
-   Remove any rows that do not have a dumpster number
-   Remove any empty columns that R reads in as “x\#”
-   Round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer

``` r
# Read and Clean the Mr. Trash Wheel Data
mr_trash_wheel <- 
  readxl::read_xlsx(path = here("hw2_data",
                                "Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx"),
                    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) %>%
  select(-starts_with("x")) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, digits = 0))
```

A few points about this data set:

-   There are 344 rows in the data set and there are 14 columns or
    variables.
-   The mean number of plastic bottles per dumpster is 1873.15.
-   The median number of glass bottles was 21.5.
-   The maximum weight of a single dumpster was 5.62 tons.
-   The minimum weight of a single dumpster was 0.96 tons.
-   The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2019 was 8.5.

Next, let’s do the following:

-   Read in the precipitation data for 2018 and 2019.  
-   Clean variable names.
-   Filter any row without precipitation data.

Additionally, when reading in this data, we can skip the first row, as
it does not contain column names nor actual data.

``` r
# Read and Clean the 2018 and 2019 Precipitation Data
eighteen_precip <- 
  readxl::read_xlsx(path = here("hw2_data",
                                "Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx"),
                    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
                    skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(!is.na(month), !is.na(total))
nineteen_precip <- 
  readxl::read_xlsx(path = here("hw2_data",
                                "Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx"),
                    sheet = "2019 Precipitation",
                    skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(!is.na(month), !is.na(total))
```

Further, because precipitation is measured in inches, we can indicate
this unit in the total variable name.

``` r
eighteen_precip <- rename(eighteen_precip, total_precip_inches = total)
nineteen_precip <- rename(nineteen_precip, total_precip_inches = total)
```

Next, let’s add a year variable and make it the leftmost column for the
2018 and 2019 precipitation data frames.

``` r
# Add year variable and position as the leftmost column
eighteen_precip <- eighteen_precip %>%
  mutate(year = 2018) %>%
  relocate(year)

nineteen_precip <- nineteen_precip %>%
  mutate(year = 2019) %>%
  relocate(year)
```

Now, we can combine the precipitation data sets and convert the month
variable to a character variable.

``` r
eighteen_nineteen_precip <- bind_rows(eighteen_precip, nineteen_precip) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

Finally, here are some facts about the precipitation data:

-   There are 12 rows (one row for each month) and 3 columns in the 2018
    precipitation data.
-   There are 6 rows and 3 columns in the 2019 precipitation data.
    -   Notice that we are missing data for the 2019 precipitation data.
-   The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches, and the total
    precipitation in 2019, for the data we have, was 16.67 inches.
-   The month with the minimum precipitation in 2018 was January, and
    the month with the maximum precipitation in 2018 was September.
-   The month with the minimum precipitation in 2019 was June, and the
    month with the maximum precipitation in 2019 was March for the data
    we have.

#### **Problem 2**

First, let’s do the following for the pols-month data:

-   Read in the pols-month data.
-   Separate the mon variable into year, month and day variables.
-   Replace the month number with a month name.
-   Create a president variable name, taking values gop and dem.
-   Remove prez\_dem, prez\_gop and the day variables.

``` r
# Read and clean the pols-month data
pols_month <- read_csv(here("hw2_data",
                            "fivethirtyeight_datasets",
                            "pols-month.csv")) %>%
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[as.integer(month)],
         president = ifelse(as.logical(prez_dem), "dem", "gop")) %>%
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day)
```

The pols-month data contains data on politicians and their political
affiliations at the state and federal level. The data set has 822 rows
and 9 columns. It contains political data from 1947 to 2015. The key
variables indicate the number of Republicans and Democrats who are
governors, representatives and senators. The data set also has a key
variable for the political affiliation of the president. In the time
frame of this data set, there has been a Republican president for 432
months, and there has been a Democrat president for 390 months.

Second, let’s do the following for the snp data:

-   Read in the snp data.
-   Separate the date variable into year, month and day variables.
-   Replace the month number with a month name.
-   Remove the day variable.

``` r
# Read and clean the snp data. The years are two digits (YY). Used lubridate
# to create dates with 4 digit years (YYYY). I then separated the different date
# components. Subtracted the year by 100 if lubridate 
# incorrectly parsed a year as being from the 2000s if it was actually 
# from the 1900s.
snp <- read_csv(here("hw2_data",
                     "fivethirtyeight_datasets",
                     "snp.csv")) %>%
  mutate(date = lubridate::mdy(date)) %>%
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>%
  mutate(year = as.character(ifelse(year > 2021, year - 100, year)),
         month = month.name[as.integer(month)]) %>%
  select(-day)
```

The snp data contains closing price data of the S&P index over time.
There are 787 rows and 3 columns. Data is collect from 1950 to 2015.
This time span is similar to that of the pols-month data except that
data collection started three years later for the snp data than it did
for the pols-month data. The key variable in this data set is close,
which is the closing price of the S&P index on the observed date. The
median closing price of the S&P index in the data set is $138.53.

Third, let’s do the following for the unemployment data.

-   Read in the unemployment data.
-   Pivot the month data from wide to long format (bring all the month
    columns into one column).
-   Convert the month from three character abbreviation to full month
    name.
-   Make the year column name all lowercase.
-   Convert year from a double to a character.

``` r
# Read and clean the unemployment data. The years are encoded as
# abbreviations. To convert to full names, convert month abbreviations to
# month numbers. Then, convert month numbers to full month names.
unemployment <- read_csv(here("hw2_data",
                              "fivethirtyeight_datasets",
                              "unemployment.csv")) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment_pct"
  ) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[match(month, month.abb)]) %>%
  rename(year = Year) %>%
  mutate(year = as.character(year))
```

The unemployment data contains unemployment percentages over time. There
are 816 rows and 3 columns. Data is collect from 1948 to 2015. This time
span is similar to that of the pols-month data except that data
collection started one year later for the unemployment data than it did
for the pols-month data. The key variable in this data set is
unemployment\_pct, which is the unemployment percentage on the observed
date. The median unemployment percentage is 5.6%.

Fourth, let’s join the data together.

``` r
# Join the data together
pols_snp_unemployment <- 
left_join(left_join(pols_month, snp, by = c("year", "month")),
          unemployment, by = c("year", "month"))
```

This data set has 822 rows and 11 columns. When a Republican has been
president, the average S&P closing price has been $378.27 and the
average unemployment percentage has been 5.93%. When a Democrat has been
president, the average S&P closing price has been $588.26 and the
average unemployment percentage has been 5.71%.
